# Advent of Code 2021

I've never fully participated in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) before, so since I just recently joined [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) which uses a bunch of Ruby, I decided that I would solve the challenges using Ruby. I am also going to throw in Rust occassionally because I am interested in learning that language because it seems cool.
